      The Victoria Unemployment and Crime (VUC) Prediction project is designed to collect and analyze the twitter post located within Victoria,
       Australia. Sentiment analysis is conducted on the harvested tweets to identify the ratio of wrath posts in each local government area.
       rther development of regression model is used to identify the relationship between the ratio of wrath tweets and two social factors:
        crime rate and unemployment rate, for years from 2014 to 2016. This model is used to predict future crime and unemployment rate in
         each area based on the currently streaming collection of Twitter data.<br/> <br/>
This project is designed and developed by a team of University of Melbourne students. Detailed information can be found below.
